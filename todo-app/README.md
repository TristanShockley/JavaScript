# Overview

As a software engineer, I aim to strengthen my front-end development skills by building practical applications that demonstrate core JavaScript concepts. This project is a designed to manage tasks through adding, removing, and marking them as completed

The purpose of this software is to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, exception handling, and the use of third-party libraries for persistent storage. Through this project, I explored how JavaScript handles events, interacts with HTML/CSS, and manages state using arrays and browser storage.
